<div align="center">Basic starter kit for a flexible GraphQL server for Node.js - based on best practices from the GraphQL community.</div>

## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express
- **GraphQL database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com) (running on MySQL)
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./database/datamodel.graphql) â€“ easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup

## Requirements

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql create`:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `node-basic` boilerplate
graphql create my-app --boilerplate node-basic

# 2. When prompted, deploy the Prisma service to a _public cluster_

# 3. Navigate to the new project
cd my-app

# 4. Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000)
yarn start
```

## Documentation

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`
* `yarn prisma <subcommand>` gives access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `yarn prisma deploy`)
